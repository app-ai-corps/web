## Empowering Appalachia Through Artificial Intelligence

The Appalachian A.I. Corps is an initiative dedicated to empowering Appalachian communities to harness artificial intelligence technologies to support their region, communities, and families.

We believe that the transformative power of AI should be accessible to all, especially the communities that have been the backbone of American innovation and resilience. Through education, collaboration, and practical application, we're building a future where Appalachian communities lead in the intelligent use of technology.
