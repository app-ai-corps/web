## RGB Activity (Part 1)
### Instructions
1. Open the [RGB Applet V2](https://appalachianaicorps.org/modules/water-quality/RGB-Applet-2.html) in a new tab.
2. Find card #1 in your deck and hold it in front of your webcam.
3. Using the middle square in the frame, record the RGB values for the card.
4. Repeat this process for all other cards in your deck.

## Scatterplots (Part 2)
### Instructions

:::{.ltorange-container}
Now you'll work in groups. Each group will be assigned either to **red**, **green**, or **blue**.
:::

1. Using the round stickies and graph paper, create a scatterplot.
2. Place the color values (either red, green or blue) on the x-axis and the nitrate concentrations on the y-axis.
