As you might have guessed, Python can do much more than just the functions **len()**, **min()**, and **max()**. In fact, it can help us calculate our measures of center!

You have already calculated the mean and median by hand on your lab sheet. Now, let's ask Python to do it!

## Calculating Measures of Center With Python

### Mean

Python has built-in tools to calculate the mean. We'll use something called **NumPy** (Numerical Python). NumPy is one example of a *library* or *package* that you can add to Python. When you add a library to Python, you are increasing the functions availble to you. For example, we have many more options with NumPy than just **len()**, **min()**, and **max()**.

We have to "import" these libraries in Python and then often give them a nickname. For example, we import NumPy as `np` instead of typing "numpy" all the time. An example of how this work has been written (and already run) below.

```{pyodide}
#| edit: false
import numpy as np

# Same sample dataset
sample_data = [1, 2, 6, 5, 1]

# Calculate mean the easy way!
mean_sample = np.mean(sample_data)

print("mean of sample data:", mean_sample)
```

**Breaking it down:**  
- `import numpy as np` = Load the NumPy library/package (we only do this once per file/page)  
- `np.mean()` = NumPy's function to calculate mean

### Your Turn: Calculate Your Group's Mean Nitrate
The website doesn't save your nitrate readings list from the previous page, so you'll need to re-enter your data into the list below (Line 3) again.

:::{#lst-groupmeannitrate}

**YOUR TURN:**  
- Recreate the list of your group's nitrate readings below  
- Run the block

```{pyodide}
#| persist: true
#| completion: false
# Recreate the list of your group's nitrate readings below

group_nitrate = [10, 20, 30, 40]

mean_nitrate = np.mean(group_nitrate)

print("Group nitrate readings (mg/L):", group_nitrate)
print("Group mean nitrate:", mean_nitrate, "mg/L")

# Is it safe? (Remember: the EPA's limit is less than 10 mg/L)
if mean_nitrate < 10:
    print("✓ Average nitrate is SAFE")
else:
    print("✗ Average nitrate is TOO HIGH")

# Try changing the numbers and see what happens!
```

Calculate and check your group's mean nitrate concentration.

## Class Data
One of the benefits of using Python is that is can handle much larger amount amounts of data with ease. For example, let's consider the nitrate and nitrite data your whole class collected. We'll do that by importing the data collected in the Google Form. That form sends the data to a spreadsheet, or CSV (comman separated values) file.

:::{#lst-getcsv}

:::{.callout-important}
## Your teacher will provide the link to the CSV file for you to use.
:::

Only edit the CSV URL in the code below (Line 4). The rest is written for you. This will pull the class nitrate and nitrite data from the CSV file so you can use it later down the page.

```{pyodide}
#| include: false
import requests
import csv
from io import StringIO

def load_class_data(csv_url):
    response = requests.get(csv_url)
    reader = csv.reader(StringIO(response.text))
    next(reader)  # Skip header
    rows = list(reader)
    
    class_nitrate = [int(row[3]) for row in rows]
    class_nitrite = [int(row[4]) for row in rows]
    
    return class_nitrate, class_nitrite
```

```{pyodide}
#| persist: true
#| completion: false
# Replace the url with the one provided from your teacher. 
# Make sure to keep the quotation marks!

csv_url = "www.replace_this_with_your_csv_url.csv"

class_nitrate, class_nitrite = load_class_data(csv_url)

print("Nitrate values:", class_nitrate)
print("Nitrite values:", class_nitrite)
```

Import your whole class's nitrate and nitrite data.
:::

### Calculating the Class Nitrate and Nitrate Mean

Using the code written to calculate the mean for your group's nitrate data, modify it to calculate the class nitrate and nitrite means.

:::{#lst-classmeannitratenitrite}

```{pyodide}
#| persist: true
#| completion: false
# Calculate mean nitrate and nitrite for class data (replace the ???)

mean_class_nitrate = np.mean(???)
mean_class_nitrite = np.mean(???)

print("Class nitrate:", mean_class_nitrate, "mg/L")
print("Class nitrite:", mean_class_nitrite, "mg/L")
```

Calculate the class nitrate and nitrite means.
:::

### Calculating the Class Nitrate and Nitrite Median

Similarly, calculate the median for the class nitrate and nitrite data.

:::{#lst-classmediannitratenitrite}

```{pyodide}
#| persist: true
#| completion: false
# Calculate median nitrate and nitrite for class data (replace the ???)

median_class_nitrate = np.median(???)
median_class_nitrite = np.median(???)

print("Class nitrate median:", median_class_nitrate, "mg/L")
print("Class nitrite median:", median_class_nitrite, "mg/L")
```

Calculate the class nitrate and nitrite medians.
:::

## Two Measures of Spread
Today, we'll discuss two measures of spread: the **range** and the **standard deviation**.

### Range
The **range** is a fairly simple calculation. It's the biggest number minus the smallest number. Or, put differently, the maximum minus the minimum in a dataset.

:::{.ltorange-container}
**max()** - **min()**
:::

Here is an example of finding the range using our sample dataset:
```{pyodide}
#| edit: false
sample_range = max(sample_data) - min(sample_data)

print("Range of sample data:", sample_range)
```

:::{#lst-classdatarange}

**YOUR TURN:** Find the range of the class nitrate and class nitrate data! Fill in the `???` with the appropriate object name and run the block.
```{pyodide}
#| persist: true
#| completion: false
class_nitrate_range = max(???) - min(???)
class_nitrite_range = max(???) - min(???)

print("Range of class nitrate data:", class_nitrate_range)
print("Range of class nitrite data:", class_nitrite_range)
```

Find the range of the class nitrate and nitrite data.
:::

### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation tells us how spread out the numbers are from the mean. Put diffently, it tells us the average distance the data in the dataset is from the mean. The formula looks a bit technical:

Here is an example of calculating the standard deviation using our sample dataset:

```{pyodide}
#| edit: false
sample_stdev = np.std(sample_data)

print("Standard Deviation of sample data:", sample_stdev)
```

:::{#lst-classdatastddev}

**YOUR TURN:** Find the standard deviation of the class nitrate and class nitrite data! Fill in the `???` with the appropriate object name and run the block.
```{pyodide}
#| persist: true
#| completion: false
class_nitrate_stdev = np.std(???)
class_nitrite_stdev = np.std(???)

print("Standard Deviation of class nitrate data:", class_nitrate_stdev)
print("Standard Deviation of class nitrite data:", class_nitrite_stdev)
```

Find the standard deviation of the class nitrate and nitrite data.
:::

## What Could Cause High Variability?

If a creek's reading has high standard deviation (lots of variability in comparison to other creeks), it might mean:

1. **Pollution events** - A factory dumps waste occasionally
2. **Storm runoff** - Rain washes fertilizer from farms into the creek
3. **Natural cycles** - Some creeks naturally vary
4. **Sensor problems** - The equipment might need calibration
5. **Different sampling times** - Morning vs afternoon can be different

It might also signal that your data has one or more ***outliers***. We'll talk more about outliers on the next page.

## Quick Reference: Python Functions

| `np.median()` | Calculates median | `np.median([7.1, 7.2, 7.3])` = 7.2 |
| `np.std()` | Calculates standard deviation | `np.std([7.1, 7.2, 7.3])` = 0.3 |
| `len()` | Counts items | `len([1, 2, 3])` = 3 |
| `max()` | Finds maximum | `max([1, 2, 3])` = 3 |
| `min()` | Finds minimum | `min([1, 2, 3])` = 1 |
