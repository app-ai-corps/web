After watching the selected video clips, included in the slides, that explain the roles of nitrogen in our water, consider the following questions:

::: {#lst-nitrogensrole .checkpoint-box}

Summarize. What is the role of nitrogen in our water? Do we want nitrates in our streams? Our drinking water? How about water with lots of nitrogen?

Nitrogen In Our Water

## Monitoring Nitrogen in the Water

Too much nitrogen in water can make both people and animals sick 🐟🐟🐟. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on what are [allowable concentrations of nitrates and nitrites in drinking water](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations). These limits are legally enforceable.

### Nitrate and Nitrite EPA Limits

**Nitrates:** 10 mg/L  
**Nitrites:** 1 mg/L

#### Monitoring Nitrogen: Your Local Utility

Local water utilities must survey and monitor the concentration of nitrogen in water to ensure that their water supply meets the EPA limits. They regularly conduct testing and report results to the appropriate regulatory agencies. You can [look up the reported nitrate concentration for water from your utility](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/) by using your zipcode.

::: {#lst-nitrogen_ewg .checkpoint-box}

Using [data from EWG](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/), what is the most recently reported nitrate concentration by your water utility?

#### Monitoring Nitrogen: You and Other Citizen Scientists!

There are a variety of ways we, as private citizens, can monitor the concentration of nitrogen in our water, too. One way is to use test strips.
