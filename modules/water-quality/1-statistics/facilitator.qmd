## **TN Standards Addressed:** 

- *BIO1.LS2.1/ECO.LS2.13/EVSC.LS2.3:* Use mathematical and/or computational representations to support explanations of factors that affect the carrying capacity of ecosystems at different scales.    
- *SCRE.ETS2.3:*  Identify the most appropriate scientific instruments and/or computer programs for different experiments and research, and learn to use, care for, and maintain them, gather data, and analyze results.    
- *PSCI.PS1.7:* Develop, or use, a model to predict or explain a phenomenon by using appropriate indicators.    
- *PSCI.PS1.8:* Develop, or use, a model to classify a substance as acidic, basic, or neutral by using pH tools and appropriate indicators.  
- *SCRE.ETS3:* Applications of Science: Select and use appropriate data tables, graphs, and diagrams to represent data. Use mathematics and computational thinking to look for patterns in data.
- *SCRE.ETS3:* Applications of Science: Select and use appropriate statistical procedures (descriptive statistics, t-tests, regression and correlation, chi-square, etc.) to analyze data.  
- *A1.S.ID.A.1:* Use measures of center to solve real-world and mathematical problems.  
- *A1.S.ID.A.3:* Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points.  
- *AGSCIENCE 3.2:* Models: Employ mathematical models to explain growth patterns and rates, both density-
dependent and density-independent factors, observed in ecosystems energy and
nutrients flow.  
- *AGSCIENCE 3.3:* Biodiversity: Evaluate the impact of habitat fragmentation, destruction, and other
environmental pressures, such as invasive species, overharvesting, pollution, and climate
change on local and global biodiversity (genetic, species, and ecosystems.) Distinguish
between types of pollution (point and nonpoint sources) and their sources to predict the
effects on environmental conditions (e.g., water, soil, and air), animal populations, and
plant populations from various kinds of human activity.

## Lesson Prep

#### 1. Prepare Materials for Nitrates Lab
The day before create water samples for nitrates lab. This will allow the nitrates to fully dissolve in the water.
 
**Materials needed:**  
  - Miracle-Gro Fertilizer (1 lb. or 1.5 lb. box of *water-soluable* blue crystal powder)  
  - Clean bucket/container to mix water + Miracle-Gro  
  - Empty gallon jugs/water-tight containers to hold/transport water samples  
  - Small cups for student use (to hold samples for testing)  
  - Nitrate/Nitrate test strips  
  - Masking tape/ sharpies to label cups/samples  

:::{.callout-important collapse="true"}
## Nitrate Sample Creation Guide
*Based on 4-5 small groups, with 3 water samples per group*

**Normal/Low range (7-9 samples) - 0-5 ppm:**

- 5-6 samples: Plain tap water (typically 0-2 ppm)
- 2-3 samples: 1/16 tsp fertilizer per gallon water (~3-5 ppm)

**Moderate range (3-4 samples) - 8-15 ppm:**

- 3-4 samples: 1/8 tsp fertilizer per gallon (~8-12 ppm)

**Extreme outliers (2-3 samples) - 30+ ppm:**

- 1-2 samples: 1/2 tsp fertilizer per gallon (~30-40 ppm)
- 1 sample: 1 tsp fertilizer per gallon (~50+ ppm, off the charts!)

#### 2. Make Copies: 1 Lab Handout Per Student

#### 3. Obtain 1 pack of like-colored Post-it Notes and 1 Sharpie/Group

#### 4. Create and Share Link for Nitrates Lab Data Collection
 - Our suggestion: Use a blank Google Sheet/Spreadsheet
 - Could pair with Google Form for data submission (meaning full sheet could be view only)
