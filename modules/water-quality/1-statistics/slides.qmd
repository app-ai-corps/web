# Intro to Water Quality

## What is Water? 💧
<hr>
[🙋🏼🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏽‍♂️]{.sixtypt-font} **Question:** What do you know about water?

:::{.fragment}
- H<sub>2</sub>O is pure water!
    - But water is almost always mixed with other things:
        - minerals
        - salts
        - other chemicals
- Some of these things help water be safe to drink, while others make it unsafe.

## Water Quality 💧
<hr>
- In the next several workshops, we will become water quality citizen scientists!

- The video discussed several indicators of water quality. We'll focus on **nitrogen** today. It can serve as both a **nutrient** and a **pollutant**.

<center>
![](images/water-quality-indicators.png){width="40%"}
</center>

## 🌳 Nitrogen as Nutrient
<hr>
- Nitrogen is naturally occurring.   
- When it combines with air and water, it forms ions: nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub>) and nitrites (NO<sub>2</sub>).
- Nitrogen within water is an important part of the nitrogen cycle, an important process necessary for life.

    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

## Nitrogen as Pollutant
<hr>
- Too much nitrogen in water can be a **pollutant**.   
- Excess nitrogen–in the form of nitrates and nitrites–can result from:
  - Agricultural operations (fertilizer runoff and livestock manure)
  - Sewage and septic systems (human waste)
  - Acid rain

## Water Quality: Nitrogen
<hr>

:::{.ltblue-container .twentyfourpt-font}
🎯 **Checkpoint 2.a**: Role of Nitrogen
:::
<br>
<br>
**🧠 What is the role of nitrogen in our water?  
<br>
🧠 Do we want nitrates in our streams?  
<br>
🧠 Our drinking water?  
<br>
🧠 How about water with lots of nitrogen?**

## Monitoring Nitrogen: Your Utility 💧
<hr>
- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on allowable concentrations of nitrates and nitrites in drinking water.

:::{.callout-important}
## Nitrate and Nitrite EPA Limits

**Nitrates:** 10 mg/L  
**Nitrites:** 1 mg/L
:::

## Monitoring Nitrogen: Your Utility 💧
<hr>
You can look up the reported nitrate concentration for water from your utility by using your zipcode.

:::{.ltblue-container .twentyfourpt-font}
🎯 **Checkpoint 2.b**: Nitrogen in Your Water
:::

**🧠 Using [data from EWG](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/), what is the most recently reported nitrate concentration by your water utility?**

# Intro to Statistics

## What is Statistics?
<hr>
- How can we make sense of the data we just collected during the nitrates lab?  
    - We can use statistics!  
- Statistics is a **collection of tools** that can be used to **analyze data**. Statistics helps us:
    - Summarize lots of numbers into one useful number  
    - Find patterns  
    - Make decisions  
    - Spot things that don't fit

## Measures of Center
<hr>
We use **measures of center** to find the central value of a group of numbers. There are different types of central values. We'll use **mean** and **median** in this lesson.
<br>

:::{.ltorange-container .center}
**Sample Dataset:**
 1, 2, 6, 5, 1
:::

### Mean
The *mean* is often called the "average". To find the mean, we add up all of the numbers of interest and divide by how many numbers there are.

:::{.ltorange-container .center}    
$\Large \frac{1 + 2 + 6 + 5 + 1}{5} = 3$
::: 
<br>
The mean value of this sample dataset is **3**.

## Measures of Center
<hr>
We use **measures of center** to find the central value of a group of numbers. There are different types of central values. We'll use **mean** and **median** in this lesson.
<br>

:::{.ltorange-container .center}
**Sample Dataset:**
 1, 2, 6, 5, 1
:::

### Median
The *median* is a different kind of measure of center. To calculate the median, you first line up all the values in your data set, then you find the middle value by position.

:::{.ltorange-container}
$\large 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 6$

## Statistics: Your Turn
<hr>

:::{.gray-container}
**Materials Needed:**  
- Lab sheet  
- Calculator  
:::

:::{.ltblue-container .twentyfourpt-font}

## 🐍 Python: Lists!
<hr>

:::{.ltorange-container .center}
**Sample Dataset:**
 1, 2, 6, 5, 1
:::

### Lists
In Python, we store multiple numbers in something called a **list**.

```{python}
# Our sample dataset from above 
# (the square brackets [ ] make it a list)

sample_data = [1, 2, 6, 5, 1]

print("Our sample data:", sample_data)
```

:::{.twentyfourpt-font}
**Breaking it down:**  
- `sample_data` = the variable name we gave our list (you can name it anything!)  
- `=` means "store this in the variable `sample_data`"  
- `[1, 2, 6, 5, 1]` = the actual numbers, separated by commas
:::

## 💻 Python: Make Your Own Lists!
<hr>

:::{.ltblue-container .twentyfourpt-font}
🎯 **Checkpoint 5.a**: Storing data as lists!
:::

:::{.dkorange-container}

if mean_nitrate < 10:
    print("✓ Average nitrate is SAFE")
else:
    print("✗ Average nitrate is TOO HIGH")
```
## Class Data

## Python: Measures of Spread
<hr>
- Spread is a second type of statistical measure.
- Like it sounds, it tells us how spread out our data are.
- Spread, also referred to as **variability**, is *the backbone* of statistics!

#### Range
The **range** is a fairly simple calculation. It's the maximum minus the minimum in a dataset.

:::{.ltorange-container}
**max()** - **min()**
:::

```{python}
# Same sample dataset
sample_data = [1, 2, 6, 5, 1]

sample_range = max(sample_data) - min(sample_data)

print("Range of sample data:", sample_range)
```

## 💻 Class Data: Range

print("Range of class nitrite data:", class_nitrite_range)
```
**Your answers will differ. This is example data.**

## Class Data: Standard Deviation
<hr>

#### Standard Deviation
- The standard deviation is another measure of spread.
- It tell us the average distance the data in the dataset is from the mean.

```{python}
# Same sample dataset
sample_data = [1, 2, 6, 5, 1]

sample_stdev = np.std(sample_data)

print("Standard Deviation of sample data:", sample_stdev)
```

print("Standard deviation of class nitrite data:", class_nitrite_stdev)
```

**Your answers will differ. This is example data.**

## ❓ Causes of High Variability
<hr>
If a creek's reading has high standard deviation (lots of variability in comparison to other creeks), it might mean:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Pollution events** - A factory dumps waste occasionally
2. **Storm runoff** - Rain washes fertilizer from farms into the creek
3. **Natural cycles** - Some creeks naturally vary
4. **Sensor problems** - The equipment might need calibration
5. **Different sampling times** - Morning vs afternoon can be different

# Boxplots Activity

## Boxplots: Visualizing Data
<hr>
- A key practice in statistics is to visualize the data!
- One type of plot we can use to do this is a **boxplot**.
- To make a boxplot, we will order the data and then divide the data into four equal groups (by number of observations), called **quartiles**.
<br>
<br>
<br>
[❗️❗️**Attention**❗️❗️ *Data Recorder (Sticky Notes)*]{.thirtyfourpt-font}

:::{.gray-container}
*Data Recorders (Sticky Notes)*, sort all of your sticky notes by color. Pass them out to each group, matching the sticky's color to the group's tent color. This will result in each group having a full set of stickies representing the class nitrate data.
:::

## 🖍️ Boxplots: Activity
<hr>

:::{.ltblue-container .twentyfourpt-font}
🎯 **Checkpoint 7.a**: As a group, construct a boxplot for the class nitrate data by hand.
:::

:::{.gray-container}
**Materials Needed:**  
- 1 Post-It grid paper sheet per group  
- 1 poster marker per group  
- Your group's full set of stickies (including those from other groups) from the nitrate lab  
- Lab sheet handout (back)  
:::

Follow the steps on the back of your lab sheet to create a boxplot for the class nitrate data.

# Boxplots & Outliers

## 💻 Class Data
<hr>
Whew! That was a lot of work. Wouldn't it be great if Python could do it for us? Good news. It can! But first, let's re-import our data on this page.

## Outliers
<hr>
**Outliers** are data points that are very different from the rest of your data.  
- Can really change your statistics—like mean and standard deviation.  
- On boxplots, outliers are represented by a circle (or sometimes a star) beyond the whiskers.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
🧠 **Do either the class nitrate or nitrite boxplot have outliers? How do you know?**

## Why Do Outliers Happen?
<hr>
Outliers can happen for different reasons:

:::incremental
1. **Buoy Malfunction** 🔧  
2. **Real Pollution Event** 🚨  
    - Factory dumped chemicals into the stream
    - Farm fertilizer washed in after a storm
    - Sewage spill
3. **Natural Event** 🌧️  
    - Heavy rain changed water chemistry  
    - Algae bloom  
    - Seasonal variation
