## Put Your Skills to the Test! 🔬

You've learned about mean, median, standard deviation, outliers, and scatterplots. Now it's time to practice with real water quality scenarios!

## The Exercise

We've created **one comprehensive exercise** that covers everything you learned in this module. You'll analyze real water quality data from multiple streams and make recommendations.

**What you'll do:**
- Calculate means, medians, and standard deviations
- Identify outliers in sensor data
- Create scatterplots to find relationships
- Make decisions about water safety
