## What is Water Quality?

When scientists study water, they measure different things to see if it's safe. You may know from science that a water molecule is H<sub>2</sub>O.  

:::{.callout-important}
## **Question:**
What does H<sub>2</sub>O mean?
:::

H<sub>2</sub>O is pure water, but water is almost always mixed with other things, like minerals, salts, and other chemicals. Some of these things help water be safe to drink, while others make it unsafe. It's also important to remember that water is used for different things, so for example, the same water can be safe for livestock and crop irrigation, but unsafe for human consumption.

Water quality also changes over time. Weather, changes in land use, changes in industrial activities and agriculture, for example, can all affect water. We can measure certain chemicals and water characteristics to monitor how water is changing over time.

## Today's Focus: Nitrogen

The video above discusses a number of indicators of water quality. The graphic shown in the video has been recreated below.

### Nitrogen as Nutrient

Today, we'll focus on one important measurement—the concentration of nitrogen in water. When nitrogen and water combine, they form nitrates and nitrites. Both nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub>) and nitrites (NO<sub>2</sub>) are a common and natural component of water. In this way, the presence of nitrogen (via nitrates and nitrites in the water) is considered *a nutrient*.

The presence of nitrogen in water is part of the nitrogen cycle, which is the process by which nitrogen is converted to other nutrients necessary for life.

### Nitrogen as Pollutant

While Nitrogen is a needed nutrient, in larger quantities it can become a *pollutant*. This excess nitrogen results primarily from agricultural operations (fertilizer runoff and livestock manure), sewage and septic systems (human waste), and acid rain.

## Monitoring Nitrogen in the Water

### 💧 Nitrate (A Type of Pollution)


**Why we care:**
- Too much nitrate can make people sick
- **Safe limit** = Less than 10 mg/L (milligrams per liter)
- If it's higher, the water isn't safe to drink


## The Big Question

Imagine you're testing water from a stream. You measure the pH seven different times and get:

**7.1, 7.2, 7.0, 7.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.1**

Quick - is the water safe? What's the "typical" pH? Are any readings weird?

That's hard to answer just by staring at the numbers! **This is why we need statistics.**

## What Are Statistics?

**Statistics** = A fancy word for "using math to understand data"

Think of statistics like a calculator that helps you:
- Summarize lots of numbers into one useful number
- Find patterns
- Make decisions
- Spot things that don't fit

**Real-world example:** When you check the weather app, it shows "Average temperature: 75°F" - that's a statistic!

## Why Do Scientists Use Statistics?

Scientists collect LOTS of data. Imagine you:
- Test water at 10 different streams
- Measure pH every day for a month
- Check nitrate levels at 5 rivers

That's a LOT of numbers! Statistics help you:
1. **Summarize**: "What's the typical pH?"
2. **Compare**: "Is Stream A cleaner than Stream B?"
3. **Detect problems**: "Is this reading normal or is something wrong?"
4. **Communicate**: "Is this water safe?" (much clearer than listing 100 numbers!)

## Let's Start Simple: Meet Python Lists

In Python, we store multiple numbers in something called a **list**. It's like a shopping list, but for data!
```{python}
# A list of pH readings (the square brackets [ ] make it a list)
ph_readings = [7.2, 7.1, 7.3, 7.0, 7.2]

print("Our pH readings:", ph_readings)
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `ph_readings` = the name we gave our list (you can name it anything!)
- `=` means "store this in the variable"
- `[7.2, 7.1, 7.3, 7.0, 7.2]` = the actual numbers, separated by commas
- `print()` = tells Python to show us the result

## Try It: Make Your Own List
```{pyodide}
# Create a list of your own numbers!
# These could be temperatures, test scores, anything!
my_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print("My list:", my_numbers)

# Let's see how many numbers are in the list
print("How many numbers:", len(my_numbers))

# 'len' means 'length' - it counts items in the list
```

**Challenge:** Change the numbers in `my_numbers` and run it again!

## Basic Operations with Lists

Once we have a list, we can do things with it:
```{python}
# Our nitrate readings from 5 rivers (in mg/L)
nitrate = [3.2, 4.1, 3.8, 3.5, 4.0]

print("Nitrate readings:", nitrate)
print("Number of rivers tested:", len(nitrate))
print("Lowest nitrate:", min(nitrate), "mg/L")
print("Highest nitrate:", max(nitrate), "mg/L")
```

**New Python words:**
- `len()` = length (how many items)
- `min()` = minimum (smallest number)
- `max()` = maximum (biggest number)

These are called **functions** - they're like tools that do specific jobs!

## Try It: Explore Your Data
```{pyodide}
# pH readings from different days
monday_to_friday = [7.2, 7.1, 7.3, 6.9, 7.2]

print("pH readings:", monday_to_friday)

# YOUR TURN: Use len(), min(), and max() to explore this data
# Example:
print("Number of readings:", len(monday_to_friday))

# Now you try finding the minimum and maximum!
```

## Types of Statistics We'll Learn

### 1. Measures of Center (What's "Typical"?)

- **Mean** = Average (add them all up, divide by how many)
- **Median** = Middle number when you line them up

**Example:** Test scores: 80, 85, 90, 95, 100
- Mean = (80+85+90+95+100) ÷ 5 = 90
- Median = 90 (it's in the middle!)

### 2. Measures of Spread (How Spread Out?)

- **Range** = Biggest minus smallest
- **Standard Deviation** = How far numbers typically are from average (we'll explain this more later!)

**Example:** Which is more consistent?
- Stream A: pH readings of 7.0, 7.1, 7.0, 7.1 (very consistent!)
- Stream B: pH readings of 6.5, 7.5, 6.8, 7.9 (all over the place!)

## Water Quality: What We're Measuring

**📺 Watch this video to learn more about pH:**

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCDSfihEhno >}}

Let's talk about what those pH and nitrate numbers actually mean:

### pH Scale
```{python}
# Let's visualize the pH scale
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ph_scale = list(range(0, 15))
colors = ['red']*3 + ['orange']*3 + ['yellow', 'lightgreen'] + ['green']*3 + ['lightgreen', 'yellow'] + ['orange', 'red']

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 3))
plt.bar(ph_scale, [1]*15, color=colors, edgecolor='black', width=1)
plt.xlabel('pH Value', fontsize=12)
plt.title('pH Scale: Where Is Water Safe?', fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(range(0, 15))
plt.yticks([])

# Mark safe drinking water range
plt.axvline(x=6.5, color='blue', linewidth=3, linestyle='--', label='Safe range')
plt.axvline(x=8.5, color='blue', linewidth=3, linestyle='--')
plt.legend(fontsize=12)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Safe drinking water: pH between 6.5 and 8.5 (the blue zone)")
```

### Nitrate Levels

![Nitrate Test Strips](images/nitrate_strip.png)


```{python}
# Visualize nitrate safety levels
categories = ['Safe\n(< 2 mg/L)', 'Acceptable\n(2-5 mg/L)', 'Concerning\n(5-10 mg/L)', 'UNSAFE\n(> 10 mg/L)']
colors_nitrate = ['green', 'lightgreen', 'yellow', 'red']

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(categories, [1, 1, 1, 1], color=colors_nitrate, edgecolor='black', width=0.6)
plt.ylabel('Safety Level', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Nitrate Safety Levels', fontsize=14)
plt.yticks([])
plt.axhline(y=0.5, color='black', linewidth=2, linestyle='--')
plt.text(3, 0.5, ' EPA Limit: 10 mg/L', fontsize=12, va='center')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Remember: Nitrate over 10 mg/L is NOT safe to drink!")
```

## Checking If Water Is Safe

Let's use Python to check if water is safe:
```{python}
# Let's check a pH reading
pH_reading = 7.2

print(f"The water has pH of {pH_reading}")

# Python can make decisions using 'if' statements!
if pH_reading >= 6.5 and pH_reading <= 8.5:
    print("✓ pH is in the safe range!")
else:
    print("✗ pH is outside the safe range!")
```

## Try It: Be a Water Inspector!
```{pyodide}
# YOUR TURN: Check if these water samples are safe

# Sample 1
pH = 7.3
nitrate = 4.2

print("=== Sample 1 ===")
print(f"pH: {pH}")
print(f"Nitrate: {nitrate} mg/L")

# Check pH (fill in the numbers!)
if pH >= 6.5 and pH <= 8.5:
    print("✓ pH is safe")
else:
    print("✗ pH is not safe")

# Check nitrate (fill in the number!)
if nitrate < 10:
    print("✓ Nitrate is safe")
else:
    print("✗ Nitrate is not safe")

# Now try changing the pH and nitrate values to see what happens!
```

## Key Python Words We Learned

| Word | What It Does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `list` | Stores multiple numbers | `[7.2, 7.1, 7.3]` |
| `len()` | Counts items | `len([1,2,3])` = 3 |
| `min()` | Finds smallest | `min([5,2,8])` = 2 |
| `max()` | Finds biggest | `max([5,2,8])` = 8 |
| `print()` | Shows results | `print("Hi!")` |
| `if` | Makes decisions | `if pH > 7:` |

**Remember:** The best way to learn is by trying things! Change numbers, experiment, and see what happens. You can't break anything! 😊
