## 🥽 Get Ready, Scientists!
We are going to conduct a brief water quality lab to practice gathering data about nitrates and nitrates in water samples.

:::{.ltblue-container}
**Materials Needed:**  
- at least four water quality samples per group  
- at least four nitrate/nitrate test strips per group  
- 1 lab notesheet per person  
- 1 computer with the submission form open for data entry  
    - link to form will be provided by your teacher  
- pencils  
- at lear four sets of multicolor sticky notes (one set per water sample)  
- 1 Sharpie markers 
- timing device (watch, clock, etc.)  
:::

## 🧑‍🔬 Preparing to Experiment!

Assign roles to each person in your group:

- **Role 1:** Data Recorder (Lab Report)  
    - *Needs:*  
        - 1 lab handout  
        - pencil  
- **Role 2:** Data Recorder (Computer)  
    - *Needs:*  
        - device (everyone else can put theirs away temporarily)  
        - submission form pulled up in browser
- **Role 3:** Data Recorder (Sticky Notes)  
    - *Needs:*  
        - sets of small sticky notes (at least four sets, one set per water sample)
        - Sharpies
- **Role 4:** Lab Technician  
    - *Needs:*  
        - water samples 
        - test strips

## Modifications for Three-Member Team
- If your team has ***three members***, one person should be the *Data Recorder (Lab Report)* and the *Data Recorder (Computer)*.
:::

## 🚀 Let's Do It!
1. **Lab Technician:** Take the first water sample, share the sample letter with your team. Then, take one new test strip and do the following:
    - Dip strip into sample for 2 seconds. *DO NOT* move the test strip while submerged.
    - Remove test strip from water.
    - Hold test strip flat for 1 minute. (Group should time this for 1 minute.)
    - Compare the colors on the test strip to those provided below. The pad on the end of the test strip indicates *nitrate* values (top row below) the second pad indicates *nitrite* values (bottom row below).

    - If the color is between two values, estimate the concentation the best you can. Often finding the midpoint between two colors is a good estimate.
    - Share the result with your team.  

2. **Data Recorder (Lab Report):** In the data table, record the following in one row per sample:
    - Sample letter
    - Nitrate value
    - Nitrite value  

3. **Data Recorder (Computer):** On the data collection form, report:
    - Group number
    - Sample letter
    - Nitrate value
    - Nitrite value  

Submit the form and click the link to submit a new form for the next water sample.   

4. **Data Recorder (Sticky Notes):**  
    - Usie the Sharpie to write the nitrate value for the sample on one full set of sticky notes. You will write the same number on multiple sticky notes. Put the full set to the side.

***REPEAT THIS PROCESS FOR ALL REMAINING SAMPLES***

## 👀 Looking Forward

When finished, with the help of the *Data Recorder (Lab Report)*, make sure everyone in your group has a copy of the data table on their own sheet. 

Good job, scientists! In the next portion of the workshop, we will analyze the data you've collected.
