title: "Measures of Spread, Spotting Outliers"
format: live-html
sidebar: lesson-1
---

A second and final statistical measure we'll discuss today is **spread**. Just as it sounds, measures of spread tell us how spread out our data are. Spread, also referred to as **variability**, is *the backbone* of statistics!

**To-Do:** We need to re-load the class csv data since the webpage doesn't save things from page-to-page. Please paste the csv link again in the block below and run it.

```{pyodide}
import requests
import csv
from io import StringIO

# Replace the url with the one provided from your teacher. Make sure to keep the quotation marks!
csv_url = "www.replace_this_with_your_csv_url.csv"

# Get the data
response = requests.get(csv_url)
reader = csv.reader(StringIO(response.text))
next(reader)  # Skip header row

# Read all rows
rows = list(reader)

# Extract columns
class_nitrate = [int(row[3]) for row in rows]  # Fourth column (index 3)
class_nitrite = [int(row[4]) for row in rows]  # Fifth column (index 4)
```

## Two Measures of Spread
Today, we'll discuss two measures of spread: the **range** and the **standard deviation**.

### Range
The **range** is a fairly simple calculation. It's the biggest number minus the smallest number. Or, put differently, the maximum minus the minimum in a dataset.

:::{.ltorange-container}
**max()** - **min()**
:::

Here is an example of finding the range using our sample dataset:
```{pyodide}
sample_data = [1, 2, 6, 5, 1]

sample_range = max(sample_data) - min(sample_data)

print("Range of sample data:", sample_range)

```

**YOUR TURN:** Find the range of the class nitrate and class nitrate data! Fill in the `???` with the appropriate object name and run the block.
```{pyodide}
class_nitrate_range = max(???) - min(???)
class_nitrite_range = max(???) - min(???)

print("Range of class nitrate data:", class_nitrate_range)
print("Range of class nitrite data:", class_nitrite_range)
```

### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation tells us how spread out the numbers are from the mean. Put diffently, it tells us the average distance the data in the dataset is from the mean. The formula looks a bit technical:

:::{.ltorange-container}
$\Large \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{n}}$
:::

Here is an example of calculating the standard deviation using our sample dataset:

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np

sample_data = [1, 2, 6, 5, 1]

sample_stdev = np.std(sample_data)

print("Standard Deviation of sample data:", sample_stdev)
```

**YOUR TURN:** Find the standard deviation of the class nitrate and class nitrite data! Fill in the `???` with the appropriate object name and run the block.
```{pyodide}
import numpy as np

class_nitrate_stdev = np.std(???)
class_nitrite_stdev = np.std(???)

print("Standard Deviation of class nitrate data:", class_nitrate_stdev)
print("Standard Deviation of class nitrite data:", class_nitrite_stdev)
```

## What Could Cause High Variability?

If a creek's reading has high standard deviation (lots of variability in comparison to other creeks), it might mean:

1. **Pollution events** - A factory dumps waste occasionally
2. **Storm runoff** - Rain washes fertilizer from farms into the creek
3. **Natural cycles** - Some creeks naturally vary
4. **Sensor problems** - The equipment might need calibration
5. **Different sampling times** - Morning vs afternoon can be different

It might also signal that your data has one ore more ***outliers***.

## What Are Outliers?

**Outliers** are data points that are very different from the rest of your data. They're the "weird" numbers that don't fit the pattern.

**Example:** pH readings from a creek: **7.1, 7.2, 7.0, 7.1, 12.3, 7.2**

That 12.3 is an outlier! It's way higher than everything else.

## Why Do Outliers Happen?

Outliers can happen for different reasons:

### 1. **Sensor Malfunction** 🔧
- The sensor glitched or needs calibration
- Battery was dying
- Sensor got knocked around

### 2. **Real Pollution Event** 🚨
- Factory dumped chemicals into the stream
- Farm fertilizer washed in after a storm
- Sewage spill

### 3. **Natural Event** 🌧️
- Heavy rain changed water chemistry
- Algae bloom
- Seasonal variation

**Your job as a scientist:** Figure out which reason it is!

## Why Outliers Matter for Water Quality

Outliers are REALLY important because:

1. **They might be pollution!** That weird high nitrate reading could mean someone dumped something bad
2. **They mess up your statistics** - Remember how the mean got messed up?
3. **They could mean broken equipment** - Your sensor might need fixing
4. **They tell a story** - What happened that day?

## Visualizing Outliers with a Box Plot

A **box plot** is a graph that shows outliers automatically! It's like a detective tool for finding weird data.
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: pH readings with some outliers
ph_data = [7.1, 7.2, 7.0, 7.3, 7.2, 7.1, 9.5, 7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 5.0, 7.3]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.boxplot(ph_data, vert=True, patch_artist=True, 
            boxprops=dict(facecolor='lightblue'),
            medianprops=dict(color='red', linewidth=2))
plt.ylabel('pH Level', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Box Plot: Outliers Shown as Circles', fontsize=14)
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='y')
plt.ylim(4, 10)

plt.text(1.15, 9.5, '← High outlier', fontsize=11, va='center')
plt.text(1.15, 5.0, '← Low outlier', fontsize=11, va='center')

plt.show()

print("The circles show outliers!")
print("The box shows where most of the 'normal' data is.")
```

**Reading a box plot:**
- The **line in the middle** = Median
- The **box** = Where the middle 50% of data is
- The **whiskers** (lines extending out) = Normal range
- The **circles** = Outliers!

## Try It: Detect Outliers
```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: You're analyzing nitrate from a creek
# Is there an outlier?
creek_nitrate = [3.1, 3.2, 3.0, 3.3, 18.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.0]

# Calculate IQR method
q1 = np.percentile(creek_nitrate, 25)
q3 = np.percentile(creek_nitrate, 75)
iqr = q3 - q1
lower_bound = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper_bound = q3 + 1.5 * iqr

print("Nitrate readings:", creek_nitrate)
print(f"\nOutlier boundaries: {lower_bound:.2f} to {upper_bound:.2f}")

# Find outliers
outliers = [x for x in creek_nitrate if x < lower_bound or x > upper_bound]
print(f"Outliers found: {outliers}")

# Make a box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.boxplot(creek_nitrate, vert=True, patch_artist=True,
            boxprops=dict(facecolor='lightgreen'))
plt.ylabel('Nitrate (mg/L)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Box Plot of Creek Nitrate', fontsize=13)
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='y')
plt.show()

# Try removing the 18.5 and run it again!
```

## What Should You Do with Outliers?

Once you find an outlier, you have some choices:

### Option 1: Keep It ✅
**When to do this:**
- It's a real measurement (like a pollution event)
- You want to study what caused it
- It's important for your research
```{python}
import numpy as np
# Example: Keep the outlier because it's a real pollution event
data_with_outlier = [2.1, 2.3, 2.2, 15.0, 2.4, 2.2]
print("Data with outlier:", data_with_outlier)
print(f"Mean: {np.mean(data_with_outlier):.2f}")
print("\nWe keep it because it shows a pollution event happened!")
```

### Option 2: Remove It 🗑️
**When to do this:**
- It's clearly a sensor error
- It's impossible (like pH of 20)
- You want to see typical conditions
```{python}
# Example: Remove the outlier because it's a sensor error
data_with_outlier = [7.1, 7.2, 7.0, 15.0, 7.2, 7.1]
data_cleaned = [x for x in data_with_outlier if x < 10]  # Remove anything above 10

print("Original data:", data_with_outlier)
print("Cleaned data:", data_cleaned)
print(f"\nMean before: {np.mean(data_with_outlier):.2f}")
print(f"Mean after: {np.mean(data_cleaned):.2f}")
print("\nMuch better! Now the mean makes sense.")
```

### Option 3: Investigate It 🔍
**Always do this first!**
- Check your field notes - What happened that day?
- Look at weather data - Was there a storm?
- Check the sensor - Is it working correctly?
- Ask: Is this reading even possible?

## Real-World Detective Work

Let's practice being water quality detectives!
```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Scenario: You're monitoring a stream near a farm
# Here are nitrate readings over 2 weeks
days = list(range(1, 15))
nitrate = [2.1, 2.3, 2.2, 2.4, 2.2, 8.5, 9.2, 3.0, 2.8, 2.9, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.6]

# Plot it
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(days, nitrate, marker='o', markersize=10, linewidth=2, color='brown')
plt.axhline(y=np.median(nitrate), color='green', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label='Median')
plt.axhline(y=10, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, alpha=0.5, label='EPA Limit')

# Highlight the spike
plt.scatter([6, 7], [8.5, 9.2], s=300, color='red', marker='X', zorder=5, label='Spike!')

plt.xlabel('Day', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Nitrate (mg/L)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Mystery: What Happened on Days 6-7?', fontsize=14)
plt.legend(fontsize=11)
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()

print("Detective Questions:")
print("1. Are Days 6-7 outliers? (YES - much higher than others)")
print("2. Are they sensor errors? (Probably NOT - both days show high values)")
print("3. What could cause this? (Possible: Heavy rain → fertilizer runoff)")
print("4. Should we remove them? (NO - this is real data showing an event!)")
print("\nConclusion: This looks like a real pollution event to investigate!")
```

## Comparing With and Without Outliers
```{python}
import numpy as np

# Example: Creek pH data with one bad sensor reading
creek_ph = [7.1, 7.2, 7.0, 7.2, 14.5, 7.1, 7.2]

# Calculate statistics both ways
print("WITH the outlier (14.5):")
print(f"  Mean: {np.mean(creek_ph):.2f}")
print(f"  Median: {np.median(creek_ph):.2f}")
print(f"  Standard Deviation: {np.std(creek_ph):.2f}")

# Remove the outlier (14.5 is impossible for creek water)
creek_ph_clean = [x for x in creek_ph if x < 10]

print("\nWITHOUT the outlier:")
print(f"  Mean: {np.mean(creek_ph_clean):.2f}")
print(f"  Median: {np.median(creek_ph_clean):.2f}")
print(f"  Standard Deviation: {np.std(creek_ph_clean):.2f}")

print("\nSee how much more accurate the statistics are without the bad reading?")
```

## Your Future: Outliers in Buoy Data

When you deploy sensor buoys in real streams, you'll see outliers! Some will be:

**Real events to study:**
- 🌧️ Storm runoff events
- 🏭 Pollution spills
- 🦠 Algae blooms
- 🌊 Seasonal changes

**Equipment issues to fix:**
- 🔋 Low battery
- 🔧 Sensor needs calibration
- 📡 Data transmission errors
- 🐟 Something bumped the sensor

The skills you're learning now will help you tell the difference!

## Quick Reference: Finding Outliers
```python
# IQR Method (copy this code!)
import numpy as np

data = [your_readings_here]

# Calculate boundaries
q1 = np.percentile(data, 25)
q3 = np.percentile(data, 75)
iqr = q3 - q1
lower = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper = q3 + 1.5 * iqr

# Find outliers
outliers = [x for x in data if x < lower or x > upper]
print("Outliers:", outliers)
```

## Try It: Multiple Outliers
```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: pH readings with several outliers
ph_readings = [7.1, 7.2, 7.0, 9.5, 7.2, 7.1, 5.5, 7.3, 7.2, 7.1, 12.0, 7.2]

# Make a box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.boxplot(ph_readings, vert=True, patch_artist=True,
            boxprops=dict(facecolor='lightcoral'))
plt.ylabel('pH', fontsize=12)
plt.title('How Many Outliers Can You Spot?', fontsize=13)
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='y')
plt.show()

# Calculate IQR method
q1 = np.percentile(ph_readings, 25)
q3 = np.percentile(ph_readings, 75)
iqr = q3 - q1
lower = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper = q3 + 1.5 * iqr

outliers = [x for x in ph_readings if x < lower or x > upper]

print("pH readings:", ph_readings)
print(f"Outliers detected: {outliers}")
print("\nWhat do you think caused each outlier?")
```

## Key Takeaways

- 🔍 **Outliers** = Data points that don't fit the pattern
- ⚠️ They could mean: pollution events, sensor errors, or data mistakes
- 📊 **IQR method** = Math way to find outliers automatically
- 📉 **Box plots** = Visual way to spot outliers (shown as circles)
- 🤔 Always **investigate** before removing outliers
- ✅ Keep outliers if they're real events worth studying
- 🗑️ Remove outliers if they're equipment errors
- 🌊 Real stream data will have outliers - you need to understand them!

## The Decision Tree

When you find an outlier, ask yourself:

1. **Is it possible?** (pH of 20 = No, pH of 8.5 = Yes)
2. **What happened that day?** (Check notes, weather, etc.)
3. **Does it fit a pattern?** (One spike vs multiple high readings)
4. **Is the sensor working?** (Check calibration, battery)

Then decide: Keep it, remove it, or investigate more!

**Next lesson:** We'll learn about scatterplots - how to see if two things (like pH and nitrate) are related!
