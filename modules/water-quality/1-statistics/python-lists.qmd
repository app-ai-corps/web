:::

## Let's Analyze Your Data With Python

:::{.ltorange-container}
**A Reminder of Our Sample Dataset**

1, 2, 6, 5, 1
:::

### Lists

In Python, we store multiple numbers in something called a **list**.

```{pyodide}
#| edit: false
# Our sample dataset from above 
# (the square brackets [ ] make it a list)

sample_data = [1, 2, 6, 5, 1]

print("Our sample data:", sample_data)
```

**Breaking it down:**  
- `sample_data` = the variablename we gave our list (you can name it anything!)  
- `=` means "store this in the variable `sample_data`"  
- `[1, 2, 6, 5, 1]` = the actual numbers, separated by commas  
- `print()` = tells Python to show us the result  

#### Try It: Make Your Own Lists

:::{#lst-groupreadings}

```{pyodide}
#| persist: true
# Create a list of your group's nitrate and nitrite readings!
# Change the 10, 20, 30, 40 to your group's real values

group_nitrate = [10, 20, 30, 40]
group_nitrite = [10, 20, 30, 40]

print("My group's nitrate readings:", group_nitrate)
print("My group's nitrite readings:", group_nitrite)

```

Save your group nitrate and nitrite readings into lists!

### Basic Operations with Lists
<hr>
Once we have a list, we can do all kinds of things with it!

#### len()

The **len()** (length) function tells us how many items are in a list. We can use it to find the number of nitrate readings we took.

```{pyodide}
print("Number of samples tested:", len(group_nitrate))
```

#### min()
The **min()** function finds the smallest number in a list. It will tell us what the lowest nitrate reading was.

```{pyodide}
print("Lowest nitrate:", min(group_nitrate), "mg/L")
```

#### max()
The **max()** function finds the biggest number in a list. It will tell us what the highest nitrate reading was.

```{pyodide}
print("Highest nitrate:", max(group_nitrate), "mg/L")
```

**In Summary:**  
- `len()` = length (how many items)  
- `min()` = minimum (smallest number)  
- `max()` = maximum (biggest number)  

These are called **functions** - they're like tools that do specific jobs!

## Checking If Water Is Safe

Let's use Python to check if water is safe. We can tell Python the maximum EPA-allowed concentration of nitrate and have it compare the maximum nitrate reading with that cut-off.
```{pyodide}
# Let's check using your group's nitrate readings
max_nitrate = max(group_nitrate)

print("The water has a max nitrate concentration of", max_nitrate)

# Python can make decisions using 'if' statements!
if max_nitrate <= 10:
    print("✓ Nitrate concentration is in the safe range!")
else:
    print("✗ Nitrate concentration is outside the safe range!")
```

## Key Python Terms We Learned

| Word | What It Does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `list` | Stores multiple numbers | `[7.2, 7.1, 7.3]` |
| `len()` | Counts items | `len([1,2,3])` = 3 |
| `min()` | Finds smallest | `min([5,2,8])` = 2 |
| `max()` | Finds biggest | `max([5,2,8])` = 8 |
| `print()` | Shows results | `print("Hi!")` |
| `if` | Makes decisions | `if pH > 7:` |

**Remember:** The best way to learn is by trying things! Change numbers, experiment, and see what happens. You can't break anything! 😊
