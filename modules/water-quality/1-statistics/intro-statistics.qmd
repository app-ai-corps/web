## Let's Use Statistics!

**Sample Dataset For Examples Below**

1, 2, 6, 5, 1

### Measures of Center
The measures of center tell us about what is typical in a group of numbers. A set of numbers has different kinds of centers: a mean, a median, and a mode. Sometimes these measures will have the same value and sometimes they will be different. We calculate them in different ways.

#### Mean
The *mean* is often called the "average". To find the mean, we add up all of the numbers of interest and divide by how many numbers there are.

:::{.ltorange-container}
$\LARGE \frac{1 + 2 + 6 + 5 + 1}{5} = 3$
:::
The mean value of this sample dataset is **3**.

#### Median
The *median* is a different kind of measure of center. To calculate the median, you first line up all the values in your data set, then you find the middle value by position.

$\Large 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 6$

The median value of this sample dataset is **2**.

Calculations—Mean & Median
:::

On your lab sheet, you have the nitrate and nitrite concentrations for each sample. Then, to the right, you have space to perform some statistical analyses and calculations.

- Calculate mean nitrate concentration
- Calculate mean nitrite concentration
- Calculate median nitrate concentration
- Calculate median nitrite concentration

**RECORD THESE ON YOUR LAB SHEET**
