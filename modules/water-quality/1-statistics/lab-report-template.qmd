## Materials
- Water quality samples (4+ samples)
- Nitrate/nitrite test strips (4+ strips)
- Timing device
- Computer for data entry
- Sticky notes and markers

## Procedure
*Steps followed to test the water samples:*

\vspace{0.2cm}

1. The Lab Technician took a water sample and shared the sample letter with the team.

2. A new test strip was dipped into the sample for 2 seconds without moving it while submerged.

3. The test strip was removed from the water and held flat for 1 minute (timed by the group).

4. The colors on the test strip were compared to the reference scale to determine nitrate and nitrite concentrations. If colors fell between two values, we estimated the midpoint.

5. Data recorders recorded the sample letter, nitrate value, and nitrite value in the data table, computer form, and on sticky notes. This process was repeated for all samples.
