**Lesson Objective:** In this lesson, you will learn how to use the Python programming language to calculate summary statistics and investigate water quality samples.

**Materials Needed:**  
- Your computer  
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)    
- Handout ??

## 🔬💧 Welcome, Scientists!  

Over the next several weeks, we will work together to understand the water in our community, its importance, nutrients, and how we can protect it. 

We will use aspects of computing and programming, statistics, and environmental and agricultural science to learn more about local waterways. In today's lesson, we will consider the role of pH in our water, how we measure it, analyze it, and consider its role in water quality and local ecosystems.

**Never used programming before? Perfect!** This module is designed for complete beginners. We'll learn everything step by step.

## 🐍 What is Python?

Python is a **programming language** — a way to give instructions to a computer. Think of it like writing a recipe, but for the computer!

**Why Python?**  
- Scientists use it to analyze data  
- It can do math way faster than we can  
- It can create beautiful graphs  

**Don't worry!** You don't need to install anything. You can run Python code right here in your web browser!

## 💻 Let's Try Python Right Now!

### Text/Strings
Python will print text.

:::{.ltblue-container}
Click the ▶️ button below to run your first Python code:
```{pyodide}
# This is a comment - Python ignores lines that start with #
# Let's make Python print a message!

print("Hello, Water Scientist!")
```

**🎉 You just ran Python code!** See how it printed "Hello, Water Scientist!" below the block? We call text printed like this a ***string***. 

Notice that strings must be in quotation marks within the code but those marks don't appear when printed. The quotation marks just tell the computer *"Hey! I'm writing regular text. Treat it like written English instead of code.,"* and it does!
:::

### Math
Now let's use Python to do some math!

:::{.ltblue-container}

➕ **Addition:**
```{pyodide}
2 + 3
```

➖ **Subtraction:**
```{pyodide}
3 - 2
```

✖️ **Multiplication:**
```{pyodide}
2 * 3
```

➗ **Division:**
```{pyodide}
3 / 2
```

:::

We can also ask Python to **compare values**:

:::{.ltblue-container}
This code asks "Is the sum of 2 and 3 greater than or equal to the product of 2 and 3?"
```{pyodide}
2 + 3 >= 2 * 3
```

This code asks "Is the sum of 2 and 3 less than or equal to the product of 2 and 3?"
```{pyodide}
2 + 3 <= 2 * 3
```

:::

### Text/Strings & Math

You can even combine the strings and math!

:::{.ltblue-container}

```{pyodide}
print("2 + 3 =", 2 + 3))
```

:::

## 🧑‍💻 Try It Yourself!

Now YOU try! Edit the code below. **Yes! You can type in the code block.** Change the numbers, change the message, then click ▶️:
```{pyodide}
# Change this message to your name!
print("My name is Student")

# Try different math problems
print("5 + 3 =", 5 + 3)
print("20 - 7 =", 20 - 7)

# Go to the end of this line and press enter. Calculate 15 times 4.
```
