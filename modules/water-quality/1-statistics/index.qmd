## 🔬💧 Welcome, Scientists!  

Over the next several weeks, we will work together to understand the water in our community, its importance, nutrients, and how we can protect it. 

We will use aspects of computing and programming, statistics, and environmental and agricultural science to learn more about local waterways. In today's lesson, we will consider the role of nitrogen in our water, how we measure it, analyze it, and consider its role in water quality and local ecosystems.

**Never used programming before? Perfect!** This module is designed for complete beginners. We'll learn everything step by step.

## 🐍 What is Python?

Python is a **programming language** — a way to give instructions to a computer. Think of it like writing a recipe, but for the computer!

**Why Python?**  
- Scientists use it to analyze data  
- It can do math way faster than we can  
- It can create beautiful graphs  

**Don't worry!** You don't need to install anything. You can run Python code right here in your web browser!

## 💻 Let's Try Python Right Now!

### Text/Strings
Python will print text. Click the ▶️ button below to run your first Python code:

:::{#lst-printstatements}

:::{.dkorange-container}
Click the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block.
:::

```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
# This is a comment - Python ignores lines that start with #
# Let's make Python print a message!

print("Hello, Water Scientist!")
```

Print Statements!

:::

**🎉 You just ran Python code!** See how it printed "Hello, Water Scientist!" below the block? We call text like this a ***string***. 

Notice that strings must be in quotation marks within the code but those marks don't appear when printed. The quotation marks just tell the computer *"Hey! I'm writing regular text. Treat it like written English instead of code.,"* and it does!
<br>
<br>

### Math
Now let's use Python to do some math!

:::{#lst-mathoperators}

:::{.dkorange-container}
Click the ▶️ Run Code button to run the blocks.
:::
➕ **Addition:**
```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
2 + 3
```

➖ **Subtraction:**
```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
3 - 2
```

✖️ **Multiplication:**
```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
2 * 3
```

➗ **Division:**
```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
3 / 2
```

Mathematical Operators!
:::
<br>
<br>
We can also ask Python to **compare values**:

:::{#lst-comparingvalues}

:::{.dkorange-container}
Click the ▶️ Run Code button to run the blocks.
:::
This code states "The sum of 2 and 3 is greater than or equal to the product of 2 and 3."
```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
2 + 3 >= 2 * 3
```

This code states "The sum of 2 and 3 is less than or equal to the product of 2 and 3."
```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
2 + 3 <= 2 * 3
```

Comparing Values!

### Text/Strings & Math

You can even combine the strings and math!

:::{#lst-printstatementsmath}

:::{.dkorange-container}
Click the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block.
:::
```{pyodide}
#| completion: false
print("2 + 3 =", 2 + 3)
```

Print Statements with Math!

## 🧑‍💻 Try It Yourself!

Now YOU try! Edit the code below. **Yes! You can type in the code block.** Change the numbers, change the message, then click ▶️:

:::{#lst-personalizedprintstatementsmath}

:::{.dkorange-container}
Make the following modifications to the block below:

- Change "Student" to your first name.
- Create a new line 9 to calculate 15 times 4. Use lines 5 and 6 as models.
- Try other math problems.

Click the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block.
:::
```{pyodide}
#| min-lines: 9
#| completion: false
# Change this message to your name!
print("My name is Student")

# Try different math problems
print("5 + 3 =", 5 + 3)
print("20 - 7 =", 20 - 7)

# Calculate 15 times 4 below. Print the equation and result.
```
