You may know from science that a water molecule is H2O.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n\nWhat does H2O mean?\n\n\nH2O is pure water, but water is almost always mixed with other things, like minerals, salts, and other chemicals. Some of these things help water be safe to drink, while others make it unsafe. It’s also important to remember that water is used for different purposes, so for example, the same water can be safe for livestock and crop irrigation, but unsafe for human consumption.\nWater quality also changes over time. Weather, changes in land use, changes in industrial activities and agriculture, for example, can all affect water. We can measure certain chemicals and water characteristics to monitor how water is changing over time."

Find Q1 (25th percentile) - 25% of data is below this 2. Find Q3 (75th percentile) - 75% of data is below this 3. Calculate IQR = Q3 - Q1 4. Anything below Q1 - 1.5×IQR is an outlier 5.

One of the types of plots we can use to do this is a boxplot, sometimes referred to as a box and whisker plot.
