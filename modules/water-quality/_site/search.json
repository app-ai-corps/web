    "text": "What is Water Quality?\nWhen scientists study water, they measure different things to see if it’s safe. You may know from science that a water molecule is H2O.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion:\n\n\n\nWhat does H2O mean?\n\n\nH2O is pure water, but water is almost always mixed with other things, like minerals, salts, and other chemicals. Some of these things help water be safe to drink, while others make it unsafe. It’s also important to remember that water is used for different purposes, so for example, the same water can be safe for livestock and crop irrigation, but unsafe for human consumption.\nWater quality also changes over time. Weather, changes in land use, changes in industrial activities and agriculture, for example, can all affect water. We can measure certain chemicals and water characteristics to monitor how water is changing over time."

    "text": "Today’s Focus: Nitrogen\nThe video above discusses a number of indicators of water quality. The graphic shown in the video has been recreated below.\n\n\n\nWater Quality Indicators\n\n\n\nNitrogen as Nutrient\nToday, we’ll focus on one important measurement—the concentration of nitrogen in water. When nitrogen, air, and water combine, they form ions—specifically nitrates and nitrites. Both nitrates (NO3) and nitrites (NO2) are a common and natural component of water. In this way, the presence of nitrogen (via nitrates and nitrites in the water) is considered a nutrient.\nThe presence of nitrogen in water is part of the nitrogen cycle, which is the process by which nitrogen is converted to other nutrients necessary for life.\n\n \n\n\n\nNitrogen as Pollutant\nWhile Nitrogen is a needed nutrient, in larger quantities it can become a pollutant. This excess nitrogen—observed as nitrates— results primarily from agricultural operations (fertilizer runoff and livestock manure), sewage and septic systems (human waste), and acid rain.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 2. a: Nitrogen In Our Water\n\n\nSummarize. What is the role of nitrogen in our water? Do we want nitrates in our streams? Our drinking water? How about water with lots of nitrogen?"

This will allow the nitrates to fully dissolve in the water.\nMaterials needed:\n\nMiracle-Gro Fertilizer Liquid\n\nDropper/Pipette\n\nSmall cups for student use (to hold samples for testing)\n\nSmall sticky notes (we use the 1.875” stickies) grouped into sets of 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, 1 yellow, etc.\n\nEach group will be assigned a color (red, green, blue, yellow, etc.), so the number of stickies in a set will be dictated by the number of groups.\n\nEach group will need one multi-colored sticky set per water sample.\n\n\n1 Sharpie/Poster marker per group\n\nNitrate/Nitrate test strips\n\nMasking tape/ sharpies to label cups/samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitrate Sample Creation Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nMixing Guide\nThis plan is written to provide samples for 5 groups with 4 samples each.\nFor 5 groups × 4 samples = 20 total samples\nFill each cup with 1 cup (8 oz) water, then add liquid fertilizer drops with dropper/pipette:\nNormal/Low Range (8 samples) - 0-5 ppm\n4 samples: Plain water (0 drops)\n4 samples: 1-2 drops per cup\nModerate Range (6 samples) - 8-12 ppm\n6 samples: 4-6 drops per cup\nMedium-High Range (3 samples) - 15-20 ppm\n3 samples: 8-10 drops per cup\nExtreme Outliers (3 samples) - 35-50 ppm\n2 samples: 20-25 drops per cup (~35-40 ppm)\n1 sample: 30+ drops per cup (50 ppm, maxes out strip)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Prepare Materials for Boxplot Activity\nMaterials needed:\n\n1 Post-It Gridded Sticky Page/Group\n\nWe pre-drew the axis on the page due to time limitations\n\n\n1 poster marker per group\n\n\n\n3. Make Copies: 1 Handout Per Student\n\nYou will need to make 1 copy per student of the workshop handout. If color-copying is not possible, make sure to have a reference of the color key for the nitrate/nitrite test strips available for each group. Note that the keys vary depending on the brand of test strips you purchase, so you may need to modify the handout to match the specific test strips you are using. Also, the colors are sensitive to lighting and printer setup, so if may be preferrable to have several bottles available for comparison to the orginal key on the bottle itself.\n\n\n\n4. Create and Share Link for Nitrates Lab Data Collection\n\nMake sure you are logged into your school Google Account\nUse this link to make a copy of the Nitrate/Nitrite Lab Google Form\nOpen your copy of the Nitrate/Nitrite Lab Google Form. Publish the form. Double check the sharing settings to make sure all of your students can respond.\n\nWhile on the sharing settings, copy the respondent link and be prepared to share this link with your students, probably via email or your LMS. Close the sharing settings.\nOn the “Responses” tab, click “Link to Sheet” &gt; “Create a New Sheet” to aggregate all of the student responses into one spreadsheet.\nOpen the spreadsheet it generates (it may automatically open) and go to “File” &gt; “Share” &gt; “Publish to web” and use the following options:\n\nWhen you click publish, it will give you a link. Please be prepared to share this link with your students during the second half of class… perhaps via email or via LMS. They will need to copy/paste it to access the data. You can set this up well in advance of class.\n\nNote: If you are facilitating this module for more than one class, you will want to repeat this process once for each class, so that each class has their own submission form and spreadsheet.\nThis can be done well in advance, just make sure to keep the form link (respondent link) and spreadsheet link (publish to web link) for each class ready to disseminate.\n\n\n\n5. Create group tents using colored paper that matches the sticky notes.\n\n\n6. Create copy of exit ticket for end-of-lesson implementation.\n\nWe have drafted a three-question exit ticket that aligns with the three major content areas of this lesson (Water Quality, Python, and Statistics). We are providing the Google Form here if you would like to use it or modify it for your own needs.\n\n\n\n7. Create copy of the exercise for after-lesson practice.\n\nWe have also created a Google Colab exercise that you can use with students to practice the concepts covered in this lesson. It is available here."

    "text": "Intro to Classification\nIn a grocery store, we often think about which specific fruits are ripe and which are not. Farmers who grow these crops make similar decisions about when their fruits and vegetables are ready to pick.\nRegardless of whether it’s the farmer or the end consumer, both of these people are making specific decisions–judgements—about whether a fruit or vegetable is ripe or not.\nThis kind of decision making is called classification.\nClassification is all about sorting things into groups based on what they look like or how they act – something humans have done forever!\n\nUse of Classification in Agriculture\nHumans have been making classifaction decisions for thousands of years. Only recently have computers begun to have the ability to make classification decisions.\nOne use of artificial intelligence (AI) is to help farmers make classification decisions, work that can be time and labor intensive when done traditionally and at scale.\n\nClassification of Ripeness (Ripe / Not)\nWe can now use AI technology to identify exactly which crops in a field are ripe and ready to be picked. See the graphic below from the University of Maryland 1 to understand how this technology works.\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 2. b: Review the figure above. In image (b), what do you think the yellow represents? The green?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Classification\nThe classification of strawberries above is considered binary, meaning there are only two possible results: ripe or not ripe.  \n\nBinary Classification\nTwo possible outcomes:  \n\n\n\nNot Ripe\n\n\n\n\nRipe\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMulticlass Classification\nWe can also classify into multiclass results like apple/orange/banana or ripe/underripe/molded produce. Multiclass classification has three or more possible outcomes:  \n\n\n\nUnderripe\n\n\n\n\nRipe\n\n\n\n\nMolded\n\n\n\n \nFor example, see the project from the University of Georgia, Athens 2 below that uses multiclass classification to sort lemons, discarding those that are underripe or molded and retaining only those that are ripe.\n\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\n\n\n\nMore on Classification with AI\nAs the video notes, computers can make classification decisions very quickly.\n​As with anything, choosing to use AI for thse sorts of tasks has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nPros:\n\nHandles millions of items quickly\n\nSpots tiny differences humans miss\n\n\nCons:\n\nNeeds tons of examples to train the computer\nBad examples = bad decisions (e.g., train only on sunny photos, it fails on cloudy days).\n​\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 2. c: If farmers use a certain company to train and decide when to pluck or harvest fruits/veggies, who gets to own that data? why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 2. d: Let’s say the company becomes better at identifying ripe fruits because they used data from your farm. Now, they want to up their subscription fees for farmers to use their model. Is that fair? Do you have any suggestions or solutions?"

That form sends the data to a spreadsheet, or CSV (comman separated values) file.\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 6. b: Import your whole class’s nitrate and nitrite data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour teacher will provide the link to the CSV file for you to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the placeholder (Line 4) with CSV URL from your teacher. Be sure the keep the quotation marks! This will pull the class nitrate and nitrite data from the CSV file so you can use it later down the page.\nClick the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn: Calculate the Class Nitrate and Nitrite Mean\nUse the code written to calculate the mean for your class’s nitrate and nitrite data.\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 6. c: Calculate the class nitrate and nitrite means.\n\n\n\nReplace the ??? placeholders (Lines 3 & 4) with the variables that hold the class nitrate and nitrite data. That is, class_nitrate and class_nitrite, respectively.\nClick the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian\n\nYour Turn: Calculate the Class Nitrate and Nitrite Median\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 6. d: Calculate the class nitrate and nitrite medians.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, replace ??? with the correct variable names to calculate the median for the class nitrate and nitrite data.\nClick the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block."

    "text": "Measures of Spread with Python\nA second and final statistical measure we’ll discuss today is spread. Just as it sounds, measures of spread tell us how spread out our data are. Spread, also referred to as variability, is the backbone of statistics!\nToday, we’ll discuss two measures of spread: the range and the standard deviation.\n\nRange\nThe range is a fairly simple calculation. It’s the biggest number minus the smallest number. Or, put differently, the maximum minus the minimum in a dataset.\n\nmax() - min()\n\nHere is an example of finding the range using our sample dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 6. e: Find the range of the class nitrate and nitrite data.\n\n\n\nReplace ??? with the correct variable names to calculate the ranges of the data.\nClick the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation\nThe standard deviation tells us how spread out the numbers are from the mean. Put diffently, it tells us the average distance the data in the dataset is from the mean.\nHere is an example of calculating the standard deviation using our sample dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 6. f: Find the standard deviation of the class nitrate and nitrite data.\n\n\n\nReplace ??? with the correct variable names to calculate the standard deviations of the data.\nClick the ▶️ Run Code button to run the block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Could Cause High Variability?\nIf a creek’s reading has high standard deviation (lots of variability in comparison to other creeks), it might mean:\n\nPollution events - A factory dumps waste occasionally\nStorm runoff - Rain washes fertilizer from farms into the creek\nNatural cycles - Some creeks naturally vary\nSensor problems - The equipment might need calibration\nDifferent sampling times - Morning vs afternoon can be different\n\nIt might also signal that your data has one or more outliers. We’ll talk more about outliers on the next page.\n Quick Reference: Python Functions \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nWhat It Does\nExample\n\n\n\n\nnp.mean()\nCalculates average\nnp.mean([7.1, 7.2, 7.3]) = 7.2\n\n\nnp.median()\nCalculates median\nnp.median([7.1, 7.2, 7.3]) = 7.2\n\n\nnp.std()\nCalculates standard deviation\nnp.std([7.1, 7.2, 7.3]) = 0.3\n\n\nlen()\nCounts items\nlen([1, 2, 3]) = 3\n\n\nmax()\nFinds maximum\nmax([1, 2, 3]) = 3\n\n\nmin()\nFinds minimum\nmin([1, 2, 3]) = 1"

To do this, you’ll use the “Preview” pane on the right side of the Teachable Machine screen.\n\n\nPutting it to the Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGet your lab sheet ready. Let’s record some results!\n\n\n\nSteps—Part A\n\nTrade your apple and orange with another group. No group should have the exact same fruits you trained the model with.\nTake your lab sheet and review the observation table. The first item to test is an apple. If the model works well, what will it predict? Record this in the second column.\nNext, hold the apple up to your camera. What does the model predict it is? Record this in the third column of your lab sheet.\nThe model also reports confidence in its prediction. Record this percent confidence in the fourth column of your sheet.\nRepeat this process for all other objects on the lab sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting & Retraining\nHow did your model perform? Were any objects classified incorrectly? Were any objects classified with low confidence (&lt; 80%)? Respond to these questions on your lab sheet.\n\n\nSteps—Part B\nLet’s improve your model. If either your apple or orange class performed poorly (missed classification or low confidence), you can adjust the model.\n\nTo do this, add about 20 new photos to the training images for the class. Be strategic about these images. Did it perform poorly when the bottom of the apple was in view? The stem? When the apple was in low light?\nYou may need to do this for 0, 1, or both classes. After that, train your model again.\nDocument any retraining on your lab sheet. Make sure to record the kinds of photos you added and your rationale for them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the Buoy\nNote that you can choose to export your model for later use. This model is quite similar to one used in the buoy to detect whether there is a new test pad in view of the onboard camera ready to analyze.\n\n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag."

Capture 100-200 images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen finished, relase the “Hold to Record” button and click to “x” in the top right corner to exit the Apple class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut your apple aside and grab your orange.

This will allow the nitrates to fully dissolve in the water.\nMaterials needed:\n\nMiracle-Gro Fertilizer Liquid\n\nDropper/Pipette\n\nSmall cups for student use (to hold samples for testing)\n\nSmall sticky notes (we use the 1.875” stickies) grouped into sets of 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, 1 yellow, etc.\n\nEach group will be assigned a color (red, green, blue, yellow, etc.), so the number of stickies in a set will be dictated by the number of groups.\n\nEach group will need one multi-colored sticky set per water sample.\n\n\n1 Sharpie/Poster marker per group\n\nNitrate/Nitrate test strips\n\nMasking tape/ sharpies to label cups/samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitrate Sample Creation Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nMixing Guide\nThis plan is written to provide samples for 5 groups with 4 samples each.\nFor 5 groups × 4 samples = 20 total samples\nFill each cup with 1 cup (8 oz) water, then add liquid fertilizer drops with dropper/pipette:\nNormal/Low Range (8 samples) - 0-5 ppm\n4 samples: Plain water (0 drops)\n4 samples: 1-2 drops per cup\nModerate Range (6 samples) - 8-12 ppm\n6 samples: 4-6 drops per cup\nMedium-High Range (3 samples) - 15-20 ppm\n3 samples: 8-10 drops per cup\nExtreme Outliers (3 samples) - 35-50 ppm\n2 samples: 20-25 drops per cup (~35-40 ppm)\n1 sample: 30+ drops per cup (50 ppm, maxes out strip)\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Prepare Materials for Boxplot Activity\nMaterials needed:\n\n1 Post-It Gridded Sticky Page/Group\n\nWe pre-drew the axis on the page due to time limitations\n\n\n1 poster marker per group\n\n\n\n3. Make Copies: 1 Handout Per Student\n\nYou will need to make 1 copy per student of the workshop handout. If color-copying is not possible, make sure to have a reference of the color key for the nitrate/nitrite test strips available for each group. Note that the keys vary depending on the brand of test strips you purchase, so you may need to modify the handout to match the specific test strips you are using. Also, the colors are sensitive to lighting and printer setup, so if may be preferrable to have several bottles available for comparison to the orginal key on the bottle itself.\n\n\n\n4. Create and Share Link for Nitrates Lab Data Collection\n\nMake sure you are logged into your school Google Account\nUse this link to make a copy of the Nitrate/Nitrite Lab Google Form\nOpen your copy of the Nitrate/Nitrite Lab Google Form. Publish the form. Double check the sharing settings to make sure all of your students can respond.\n\nWhile on the sharing settings, copy the respondent link and be prepared to share this link with your students, probably via email or your LMS. Close the sharing settings.\nOn the “Responses” tab, click “Link to Sheet” &gt; “Create a New Sheet” to aggregate all of the student responses into one spreadsheet.\nOpen the spreadsheet it generates (it may automatically open) and go to “File” &gt; “Share” &gt; “Publish to web” and use the following options:\n\nWhen you click publish, it will give you a link. Please be prepared to share this link with your students during the second half of class… perhaps via email or via LMS. They will need to copy/paste it to access the data. You can set this up well in advance of class.\n\nNote: If you are facilitating this module for more than one class, you will want to repeat this process once for each class, so that each class has their own submission form and spreadsheet.\nThis can be done well in advance, just make sure to keep the form link (respondent link) and spreadsheet link (publish to web link) for each class ready to disseminate.\n\n\n\n5. Create group tents using colored paper that matches the sticky notes.\n\n\n6. Create copy of exit ticket for end-of-lesson implementation.\n\nWe have drafted a three-question exit ticket that aligns with the three major content areas of this lesson (Water Quality, Python, and Statistics). We are providing the Google Form here if you would like to use it or modify it for your own needs.\n\n\n\n7. Create copy of the exercise for after-lesson practice.\n\nWe have also created a Google Colab exercise that you can use with students to practice the concepts covered in this lesson. It is available here."

    "text": "Intro to Classification\nIn a grocery store, we often think about which specific fruits are ripe and which are not. Farmers who grow these crops make similar decisions about when their fruits and vegetables are ready to pick.\nRegardless of whether it’s the farmer or the end consumer, both of these people are making specific decisions–judgements—about whether a fruit or vegetable is ripe or not.\nThis kind of decision making is called classification.\nClassification is all about sorting things into groups based on what they look like or how they act – something humans have done forever!\n\nUse of Classification in Agriculture\nHumans have been making classifaction decisions for thousands of years. Only recently have computers begun to have the ability to make classification decisions.\nOne use of artificial intelligence (AI) is to help farmers make classification decisions, work that can be time and labor intensive when done traditionally and at scale.\n\nClassification of Ripeness (Ripe / Not)\nWe can now use AI technology to identify exactly which crops in a field are ripe and ready to be picked. See the graphic below from the University of Maryland 1 to understand how this technology works.\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 2. b: Review the figure above. In image (b), what do you think the yellow represents? The green?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Classification\nThe classification of strawberries above is considered binary, meaning there are only two possible results: ripe or not ripe.  \n\nBinary Classification\nTwo possible outcomes:  \n\n\n\nNot Ripe\n\n\n\n\nRipe\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMulticlass Classification\nWe can also classify into multiclass results like apple/orange/banana or ripe/underripe/molded produce. Multiclass classification has three or more possible outcomes:  \n\n\n\nUnderripe\n\n\n\n\nRipe\n\n\n\n\nMolded\n\n\n\n \nFor example, see the project from the University of Georgia, Athens 2 below that uses multiclass classification to sort lemons, discarding those that are underripe or molded and retaining only those that are ripe.\n\n\n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Classification with AI\nAs the video notes, computers can make classification decisions very quickly.\n​As with anything, choosing to use AI for thse sorts of tasks has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nPros:\n\nHandles millions of items quickly\n\nSpots tiny differences humans miss\n\n\nCons:\n\nNeeds tons of examples to train the computer\nBad examples = bad decisions (e.g., train only on sunny photos, it fails on cloudy days).\n​\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 2. c: If farmers use a certain company to train and decide when to pluck or harvest fruits/veggies, who gets to own that data? why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 2. d: Let’s say the company becomes better at identifying ripe fruits because they used data from your farm. Now, they want to up their subscription fees for farmers to use their model. Is that fair? Do you have any suggestions or solutions?"

It just hides the 🐍 Python in the background.\n\nSteps\n\n\n\nGo to Teachable Machine\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Get Started”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose “Image Project”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect “Standard Image Model”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the right of “Class 1”, click the pencil and type “Apple”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab your apple and get ready!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “webcam” to turn on and allow the computer to begin capturing images of the apple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRO TIP\n\n\n\nMake sure you have a clean table and avoid messy backgrounds. Vary the lighting in your images (window, light, lamp, shadow, etc.) like might be encountered in real scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition your apple within the frame and click the “Hold to Record” button to begin capturing images of the apple. You will want to move the apple around so it captures different angles and distances. Capture 100-200 images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen finished, relase the “Hold to Record” button and click to “x” in the top right corner to exit the Apple class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut your apple aside and grab your orange. Repeat the process above to train your model for Class 2. Try to capture roughly the same number of images for the orange as you did for the apple.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen finished capturing data for both classes, click the “Train Model” button. The website will train your own custom classification model, based on your data!\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You have trained your own classifier! Now let’s see how well it works."

If the model works well, what will it predict? Record this in the second column.\nNext, hold the apple up to your camera. What does the model predict it is? Record this in the third column of your lab sheet.\nThe model also reports confidence in its prediction.

Instead, computers understand color through numbers.\nWhen a computer displays or processes an image, that image is really a combination of millions of little squares called pixels, and each of these pixels has a value for Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). The color of each pixel is a combination of these three values.\nLet’s take a look at how this works!\n\n\nPixels and RGB Values\n\n\n\n🎯 Checkpoint 6. a: Exploring pixels and RGB Values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials Needed:\n\nAPPLET\n\nThis will open in a new tab.\nYou may need to grant access to your camera for it to work.\nApple, Orange, Lime (from previous activity)\n\nHandout\nPencil\n\n\nUse the applet and follow the instructions on the handout, which are also listed below.\n\nThe applet starts with “What Humans See” selected. Hold the apple up to the camera. Notice it captures its likeness?\nChange the mode to “What Computers See”. It will default to the Red channel first.\nFocus on an area at the center of the apple and record the value for R.\nUse the dropdown menu to change the channel to G. Look at the same area (or as close to possible) on the apple, record the value for G.\nRepeat this process for the B channel.\nRepeat this process for the orange, lime, and each of the purple cards."
