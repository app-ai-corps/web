Think of a time that you have had to sort something. Let's discuss!

## Intro to Classification
Classification is all about sorting things into groups based on what they look like or how they act – something humans have done forever!

### Everyday Classification (Pre-AI Era)
Think back 100+ years: Farmers classified crops as "healthy" or "sick" by spotting yellow leaves or spots. Biologists like Carl Linnaeus created systems to group animals and plants – Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (e.g., humans are Animalia > Chordata > Mammalia > Primates).

Doctors sorted sicknesses: "fever with rash = maybe measles." Librarians filed books by categories like fiction or science. No computers – just eyes, rulers, keys (like plant ID guides), and experts agreeing (or arguing!).

Quick Pair-Share: Name something you classify every day without technology. How do humans decide the groups?

### Classification Now with AI
Today, computers do it super fast using machine learning: Feed thousands of labeled examples (e.g., 500 spam emails marked "bad," 500 good ones "ok"), and the AI learns patterns to label new ones automatically.

Binary: Two groups, like spam/not spam or cat/dog. Multiclass: Many groups, like apple/orange/banana or healthy/sick/wilted corn.
​
Pros: Handles millions of items quickly, spots tiny differences we miss. Cons: Needs tons of examples; can goof if data is biased (e.g., only daytime photos).
​
Examples: Email filters block junk; photo apps tag "beach" or "mountain"; doctors' tools flag diseases from X-rays; self-driving cars spot "pedestrian" vs. "car."

Quick Poll: Could AI beat a farmer at spotting sick corn leaves? Thumbs up for yes, thumbs down for no. Why?

**Your job as a scientist:** Practice Classifying!!! The next step will involve a classification activity. It will challenge both your ceonceptual understanding of classification, as well as introduce you to classifying with AI!
