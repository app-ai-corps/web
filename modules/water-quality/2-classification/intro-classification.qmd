Which banana(s) would you eat?

#### Classification of Ripeness (Ripe / Not)
We can now use AI technology to identify exactly which crops in a field are ripe and ready to be picked. See the graphic below from the University of Maryland [^1] to understand how this technology works.

Review the figure above. In image (b), what do you think the yellow represents? The green?

If farmers use a certain company to train and decide when to pluck or harvest fruits/veggies, who gets to own that data? why?

Let’s say the company becomes better at identifying ripe fruits because they used data from your farm. Now, they want to up their subscription fees for farmers to use their model. Is that fair? Do you have any suggestions or solutions?
