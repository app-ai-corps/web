**Lesson Objective:** In this lesson, you will learn how to use classification and Python to help computers recognize water sample test strips and understand how color (RGB) can be used to monitor water quality.

**Materials Needed:**  
- Your computer  
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)

## 🔬💧 Welcome Back, Scientists!  

:::{#lst-review}
- Let's remember what we learned during workshop #1:
  - The role of nitrogen in our water
  - Using statistics to summarize data
  - Using Python to store, summarize, and visualize data

Review—Looking back to Workshop #1

## Meet the Buoy!

- This is Smokey Buoy!
  - This class will be deploying Smokey Buoy(s) later this semester.
  - We will learn a bit about how it works, so you understand it before we use them.

- Under the cover, Smokey Buoy has a lot of parts!
  - Two of these include:
    - A motorized unit that moves the test strips
    - A built-in camera system to analyze those strips on the spot

### The Buoy: Test Strips

- Smokey Buoy also uses test strips to monitor nitrate concentrations in water. The buoy's test strips are on a roll rather than small strips. We place each pad on a very long piece of material and roll it up inside the buoy to keep it dry until dispensed.

![1. We begin with commercial test strips and remove the pads. <br> 2. The pads are carefully spaced out and placed on a very long piece of material. <br> 3. The material is rolled up inside the buoy. <br> 4. The roll is carefully positioned to be fed through the motorized roller.](images/buoy_test_strip_roll.png)

### The Buoy: Motor & Camera

![Modified from INSERT PAPER CITATION](images/buoy_diagram_modified.png){width="50%"}

#### Motor
Locate the motor near the top of the diagram. The motor drives the roller, which grips and advances the test strip roll.

#### Camera
When a test pad is in front of the camera, it takes a picture.

### 🎥 See It In Action!

**Think Pair Share:** Thinking back to the nitrates activity from last week, What are the benefits to using a computerized buoy to conduct water quality tests? Drawbacks?
