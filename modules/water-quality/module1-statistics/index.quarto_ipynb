    "## Welcome, Scientists! 🔬💧\n",
    "\n",
    "You're about to become a water quality detective! In this module, you'll learn how to analyze real water samples using something called **statistics** (don't worry, it's easier than it sounds) and a programming language called **Python**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never used Python before? Perfect!** This module is designed for complete beginners. We'll teach you everything step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Will You Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Understand if water is safe to drink\n",
    "- ✅ Spot unusual water quality readings\n",
    "- ✅ Compare water from different streams or rivers\n",
    "- ✅ Use Python to analyze data (yes, real coding!)\n",
    "- ✅ Create graphs and charts like a scientist\n",
    "- ✅ Make decisions about water safety\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Water Quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "When scientists study water, they measure different things to see if it's safe. We'll focus on two important measurements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌡️ pH (Acidity/Alkalinity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of pH like a thermometer, but for how acidic or basic water is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pH of 7** = Neutral (like pure water)\n",
    "- **Below 7** = Acidic (like lemon juice or vinegar)\n",
    "- **Above 7** = Basic/Alkaline (like baking soda in water)\n",
    "- **Safe drinking water** = Between 6.5 and 8.5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world example:** If your pool has the wrong pH, your eyes sting when you swim!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💧 Nitrate (A Type of Pollution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrate is a chemical that can get into water from:\n",
    "- Fertilizers from farms\n",
    "- Sewage and septic systems\n",
    "- Natural sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we care:**\n",
    "- Too much nitrate can make people sick\n",
    "- **Safe limit** = Less than 10 mg/L (milligrams per liter)\n",
    "- If it's higher, the water isn't safe to drink\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **programming language** - a way to give instructions to a computer. Think of it like writing a recipe, but for the computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Python?**\n",
    "- Scientists use it to analyze data\n",
    "- It's one of the easiest languages to learn\n",
    "- It can do math way faster than we can\n",
    "- It can create beautiful graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't worry!** You don't need to install anything. You can run Python code right here in your web browser!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's Try Python Right Now!\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the ▶️ button below to run your first Python code:\n",
    "```{pyodide}\n",
    "# This is a comment - Python ignores lines that start with #\n",
    "# Let's make Python do some math!\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello, Water Scientist!\")\n",
    "print(\"2 + 2 =\", 2 + 2)\n",
    "print(\"10 divided by 2 =\", 10 / 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎉 You just ran Python code!** See how it printed messages and did math?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Try It Yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now YOU try! Edit the code below. Change the numbers, change the message, then click ▶️:\n",
    "```{pyodide}\n",
    "# Change this message to your name!\n",
    "print(\"My name is Student\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Try different math problems\n",
    "print(\"5 + 3 =\", 5 + 3)\n",
    "print(\"20 - 7 =\", 20 - 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can you make it calculate 15 times 4?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing! Everything works in your web browser. Just:\n",
    "- A computer or tablet\n",
    "- An internet connection\n",
    "- Your curiosity! 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction** - What are statistics and why do scientists use them?\n",
    "2. **Mean and Standard Deviation** - Finding the average and understanding if data is consistent\n",
    "3. **Median and Range** - Another way to find the \"middle\" and see how spread out data is\n",
    "4. **Outliers** - Finding weird data that doesn't fit (might be pollution or a broken sensor!)\n",
    "5. **Scatterplots** - Creating graphs to see if two things are related\n",
    "6. **Exercises** - Practice with real water quality scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Quick Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a sneak peek of what you'll be able to do:\n",
    "```{pyodide}\n",
    "# This code analyzes pH readings from a stream\n",
    "ph_readings = [7.2, 7.1, 7.3, 7.0, 7.2]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the average (you'll learn this soon!)\n",
    "average_ph = sum(ph_readings) / len(ph_readings)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"pH readings from the stream:\", ph_readings)\n",
    "print(\"Average pH:\", average_ph)\n",
    "\n",
    "if average_ph >= 6.5 and average_ph <= 8.5:\n",
    "    print(\"✓ Water pH is SAFE for drinking!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"✗ Water pH is outside safe range!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pretty cool, right?** Soon you'll understand every line of that code!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ready to Begin?\n",
    "\n",
    "Click \"Introduction\" in the menu to start your journey as a water quality scientist!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: **Everyone starts as a beginner.** If something doesn't make sense, that's normal! Try it again, experiment, and ask questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go! 🚀"
